                Bonsai Plants</h2>
            <!-- <div class="define">
                <p class="paragraph" style="position: relative; left: 65px;">Bonsai is a art of growing trees in small
                    containers.
                    Firstly, it is necessary to think about the difference with “a potted plant” to define the
                    bonsai.<br>
                    Any plant becomes the potted plant if set into a pot.
                    The important characteristic of the bonsai must not be able to greatly grow up idly. It is the
                    volume of the root that decides the size of the tree. In the case of a bonsai, prevent the expansion
                    of the root by putting it in the small pot daringly. And techniques such as pruning wiring branches
                    and disbudding used to limit growth.<br>

                    A basic idea of a bonsai is a replication of nature, in the form of a miniature tree set into a pot,
                    mimic the shape and scale of full size trees. It is a culture producing scenery of nature on the
                    pot. Bonsai is a collaboration between the vitality of trees and the skills of human beings.

                            Technology can have both positive and negative impacts on the sale of bonsai plants. Some of
                            the potential effects include:<br>
                            <b>Positive Impact</b>: Online marketplaces and social media platforms can make it easier
                            for bonsai growers and sellers to reach a wider audience and sell their plants to customers
                            all over the world. Online tutorials and videos can also be helpful for customers who are
                            new to bonsai cultivation.<br>
                            Technology like drones can be used to take aerial shots of bonsai gardens. This can be used
                            to market and sell the bonsai plants.<br>
                            Use of technology like the internet, can educate customers about the proper care of bonsai
                            plants, which can help increase sales and customer satisfaction.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            <b>Negative Impact</b>: Online marketplaces can also make it easier for unscrupulous sellers
                            to market and sell counterfeit or low-quality bonsai plants to unsuspecting customers.
                            Online marketplaces can also increase competition for legitimate sellers and make it harder
                            to stand out.<br>
                            Technology such as automation can take away the jobs of people in the bonsai industry.
                            Online sales can reduce the personal touch that customers may receive when buying bonsai
                            plants in person.

                <p class="paragraph" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 20px;">In conclusion, technology has had a
                    significant impact on the practice of bonsai. On the positive side, it has made it easier for
                    bonsai enthusiasts to access information and resources, and to purchase bonsai plants online.
                    However, it has also led to the spread of invasive species and the purchase of bonsai plants
                    without proper care and maintenance knowledge. It is important for bonsai enthusiasts to be
                    mindful of the potential negative impacts of technology when buying bonsai plants online and to
                    ensure they have proper knowledge to care for the tree.<br>

                    In summary, technology is a double-edged sword, it's a great tool to improve our knowledge and
                    skills in bonsai, but it should not be a replacement for traditional ways of learning and
                    practicing the art. It's important for enthusiasts to use technology responsibly and to balance
                    the benefits it brings with the preservation of the traditional art form.
